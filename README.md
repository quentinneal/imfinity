## Description

This project is an infinite scrolling website with search features. The images are fetched from the NASA Image and Video Library REST API. The infinite scrolling mechanism uses the Intersection Observer API.

I've realized that other developers understanding your code is just as important as writing it, so I decided to put extra effort into keeping the code in this project organized and easy to understand.

I've learned some interesting data manipulation techniques that will be useful in my career.
