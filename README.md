# Infinity

An Infinite scrolling application with search features. Uses the NASA Image and Video Library API.

## Note: CORS

The API has a rate limit, and the website will temporarily stop calling the API after a certain amount of API calls. This is based on the IP address of the user.

## Description

This project is an infinite scrolling website with search features. The images are fetched from the NASA Image and Video Library REST API. The infinite scrolling mechanism uses the Intersection Observer API.

I've realized that other developers understanding your code is just as important as writing it, so I decided to put extra effort into keeping the code in this project organized and easy to understand.

I've learned some interesting data manipulation techniques that will be useful in my career.
